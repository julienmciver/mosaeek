# mosaeek
Mobile tool for creating mosaics

Currently, this app requires you to first use my desktop pixArt generator. The link to which is here: https://github.com/julienmciver/pixArtGenerator

For the full set of instructions on how to use the app, follow the link above. I plan on rebuilding this in Android Studio, and making it a standalone mobile app that requires no desktop support. Watch this space.
